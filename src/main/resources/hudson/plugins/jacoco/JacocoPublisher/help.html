<div>
	Allows to configure various aspects of the JaCoCo code coverage report. The pathes define where the various types of files
	can be found in the workspace, inclusions and exclusions allow to exclude certain class files.
	
	And the coverage thresholds allow to configure how much coverage is necessary to make the build green (if changing the build
	status is enabled).
