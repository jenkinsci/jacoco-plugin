=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin)
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin.svg)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jacoco-plugin/releases)

A plugin for Jenkins to capture and visualize code coverage testing results for projects using the 
JaCoCo for code-coverage analysis.

More information can be found on the Wiki page https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JaCoCo+Plugin

Note: Version 2.0.0 and higher requires using JaCoCo 0.7.5 or newer, if your projects still use JaCoCo 0.7.4, 
the plugin will not display any code-coverage numbers any more! In this case please use version 1.0.19 until you can update jacoco in your codebase.
